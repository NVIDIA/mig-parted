# MIG ***Part***iton ***Ed***itor for NVIDIA GPUs

MIG (short for Multi-Instance GPU) is a mode of operation in the newest
generation of NVIDIA Ampere GPUs. It allows one to partition a GPU into a set
of "MIG Devices", each of which appears to the software consuming them as a
mini-GPU with a fixed partition of memory and a fixed partition of compute
resources. Please refer to the [MIG User
Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/mig-user-guide/index.html) for
a detailed explanation of MIG and the features it provides.

The MIG ***Part***iton ***Ed***itor (`nvidia-mig-parted`) is a tool designed
for system administrators to make working with MIG partitions easier.

It allows administrators to ***declaratively*** define a set of possible MIG
configurations they would like applied to all GPUs on a node. At runtime, they
then point `nvidia-mig-parted` at one of these configurations, and
`nvidia-mig-parted` takes care of applying it. In this way, the same
configuration file can be spread across all nodes in a cluster, and a runtime
flag (or environment variable) can be used to decide which of these
configurations to actually apply to a node at any given time.

As an example, consider the following configuration for an NVIDIA DGX-A100 node
(found in the `examples/config.yaml` file of this repo):
```
version: v1
mig-configs:
  all-disabled:
    - devices: all
      mig-enabled: false

  all-enabled:
    - devices: all
      mig-enabled: true
      mig-devices: {}

  all-1g.5gb:
    - devices: all
      mig-enabled: true
      mig-devices:
        "1g.5gb": 7

  all-2g.10gb:
    - devices: all
      mig-enabled: true
      mig-devices:
        "2g.10gb": 3

  all-3g.20gb:
    - devices: all
      mig-enabled: true
      mig-devices:
        "3g.20gb": 2

  all-balanced:
    - devices: all
      mig-enabled: true
      mig-devices:
        "1g.5gb": 2
        "2g.10gb": 1
        "3g.20gb": 1

  custom-config:
    - devices: [0,1,2,3]
      mig-enabled: false
    - devices: [4]
      mig-enabled: true
      mig-devices:
        "1g.5gb": 7
    - devices: [5]
      mig-enabled: true
      mig-devices:
        "2g.10gb": 3
    - devices: [6]
      mig-enabled: true
      mig-devices:
        "3g.20gb": 2
    - devices: [7]
      mig-enabled: true
      mig-devices:
        "1g.5gb": 2
        "2g.10gb": 1
        "3g.20gb": 1
```
Each of the sections under `mig-configs` is user-defined, with custom labels
used to refer to them. For example, the `all-disabled` label refers to the MIG
configuration that disables MIG for all GPUs on the node. Likewise, the
`all-1g.5gb` label refers to the MIG configuration that slices all GPUs on the
node into `1g.5gb` devices. Finally, the `custom-config` label defines a
completely custom configuration which disables MIG on the first 4 GPUs on the
node, and applies a mix of MIG devices across the rest.

Using this tool the following commands can be run to apply each of these
configs, in turn:
```
$ nvidia-mig-parted apply -f examples/config.yaml -c all-disabled
$ nvidia-mig-parted apply -f examples/config.yaml -c all-1g.5gb
$ nvidia-mig-parted apply -f examples/config.yaml -c all-2g.10gb
$ nvidia-mig-parted apply -f examples/config.yaml -c all-3g.20gb
$ nvidia-mig-parted apply -f examples/config.yaml -c all-balanced
$ nvidia-mig-parted apply -f examples/config.yaml -c custom-config
```

The currently applied configuration can then be looked up with:
```
$ nvidia-mig-parted export
version: v1
mig-configs:
  current:
  - devices: all
    mig-enabled: true
    mig-devices:
      1g.5gb: 2
      2g.10gb: 1
      3g.20gb: 1
```

And asserted with:
```
$ nvidia-mig-parted assert -f examples/config.yaml -c all-balanced
Selected MIG configuration currently applied

$ echo $?
0

$ nvidia-mig-parted assert -f examples/config.yaml -c all-1g.5gb
ERRO[0000] Assertion failure: selected configuration not currently applied

$ echo $?
1
```

**Note:** The `nvidia-mig-parted` tool alone does not take care of making sure
that your node is in a state where MIG mode changes and MIG device
configurations will apply cleanly. Moreover, it does not ensure that MIG device
configurations will persist across node reboots.

To help with this, a `systemd` service and a set of support scripts have been
developed to wrap `nvidia-mig-parted` and provide these much desired features.
Please see the README.md under [deployments/systemd](deployments/systemd) for
more details.

## Installing `nvidia-mig-parted`

At the moment, there is no common distribution platform for
`nvidia-mig-parted`. However, we do build `deb`, `rpm` and `tarball` packages
and distribute them as assets with every release. Please see our release page
[here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/mig-parted/releases) to download them and
install them.

To build from source, please follow one of the methods below.

#### Use `docker` with `go install`:
```
${DOCKER} run \
    -v $(pwd):/dest \
    golang:1.16.4 \
    sh -c "
    go install github.com/NVIDIA/mig-parted/cmd@latest
    mv /go/bin/cmd /dest/nvidia-mig-parted
    "
```

#### Run `go get` and `go install` directly:
```
GO111MODULE=off go get -u github.com/NVIDIA/mig-parted/cmd/nvidia-mig-parted
GOBIN=$(pwd)    go install github.com/NVIDIA/mig-parted/cmd/nvidia-mig-parted
```

#### Clone the repo and build it:
```
git clone http://github.com/NVIDIA/mig-parted
cd mig-parted
go build ./cmd/nvidia-mig-parted
```

When followed exactly, any of these methods should generate a binary called
`nvidia-mig-parted` in your current directory. Once this is done, it is advised
that you move this binary to somewhere in your path, so you can follow the
commands below verbatim.
